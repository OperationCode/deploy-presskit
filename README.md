We are military veterans designers and developers who turn your business concept into a functioning product on the internet. Deploy military veterans turn your business concept into a functioning product on the internet, from domain registration and email setup to your first minimal viable project and monthly maintenance.

Clients hire us because we’re mission-driven, employ military veterans, and profits fuel our organization’s growth to serve more military veterans. Clients hire us because we’ve served our country, love to code, work in small teams, and are fluent in web technologies.

We enjoy learning software craftsmanship, building [operationcode.org](https://operationcode.org), attending meetups and software conferences, mentoring and helping fellow veterans and their families get coding, and ensuring our nation’s finest don’t get left behind in the 21st century new skills economy.

Deploy started as an experiment in the fall of 2015 to shorten the dreaded junior time gap for code school graduates by working on real-world web applications for veteran entrepreneurs. Our first real-world application was for a retired Air Force Master Sergeant. The first Deploy apprentices were: Ming Zhang, Krystyna Ewing and John Hampton.
